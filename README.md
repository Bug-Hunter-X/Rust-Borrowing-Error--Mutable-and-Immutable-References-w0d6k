This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming concerning mutable and immutable borrowing. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to simultaneously create a mutable and an immutable reference to the same variable, which violates Rust's borrowing rules. The `bugSolution.rs` file presents a solution by restructuring the code to avoid conflicting borrows.
